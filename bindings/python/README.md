The python binding for the [rf24-rs] project (written in rust).

This package is only functional on Linux machines.
Although, installing this package in non-Linux environments will
provide the typing information used on Linux.

See the [docs] for more detail about the API.

## Install

To install from pypi.org:

```text
pip install rf24-py
```

To build from source, the [rf24-rs] project uses [uv] to manage dependencies:

```text
uv sync
```

Append `--no-dev` for environments with limited disk space (eg. Raspberry Pi machine).

[uv]: https://docs.astral.sh/uv

## Examples

The examples are located in [the repository's root path][rf24-rs] "examples/python".
To run the examples, simply pass the example file's path to the python interpreter:

```text
uv run examples/python/getting_started.py
```

Again, the `--no-dev` argument can be applied to the `uv run` command for
environments with limited disk space.

The examples/python/irq_config.py script requires the [gpiod] package.
The `uv run` command needs to be amended to include this dependency:

```text
uv run --with gpiod examples/python/irq_config.py
```
